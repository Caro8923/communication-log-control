      <p>Hello Pilot Tom! Thanks for flying this plane.</p>
      <p>The flight should be smooth sailing. It looks like the storms
         have passed. I can see clearly now the rain has gone... Any changes to 
         the flight?
      </p>
      <p>No changes. Weather clear. Remember the three rules of flight school: Navigate, Aviate, Communicate!</p>
      <p> Ahhh yes! Absolutely, the 3 rules of flight school, one mustn't ever forget.
